**Author: Alexander Weigl** under GPLv2+

KeY is a interactive deductive theorem prover for proving the properties in Java Programs. 
See [key-project.org](https://key-project.org) for more details. 

This mono-repository provides several tools in the KeY ecosystem:

1. <citool/> -- A tool for embedding KeY in continous integration workflows. 
2. <tadoc/> -- Tool for the documentation generation of Taclet (sorts, function, proof rules in KeY)
3. <miniweb/> --  A simple web-interface for using KeY.
4. <interactionlog> -- A plugin for KeY to record and re-apply user interaction. 

# tadoc -- Generation of Taclet Documentation 



## TODO/Bugs

* pretty printing not working quite right
  * replacewith could be more formatted
  * `<sort>::<id>` -- id is not printed
* documentation formatting, especially trim the indentation
